# IT Onboarding Process Optimization (Mac-First Environment)

## Overview

This project simulates a structured IT onboarding workflow designed for a modern, Mac-first startup environment.

The objective of this project was to standardize:

- Account provisioning
- Device configuration
- Security enforcement (MFA & encryption)
- Inventory management
- Offboarding procedures

This workflow is designed to reduce setup errors, improve turnaround time for new hires, and enforce secure access lifecycle management.

## Problem Statement

In fast-growing startups, onboarding often becomes inconsistent due to:

- Missing tool access
- Delayed laptop configuration
- Weak MFA enforcement
- Incomplete documentation
- Security gaps during offboarding

Unstructured onboarding increases operational risk and support overhead.

---

## Solution

Designed a structured onboarding workflow that includes:

- Step-by-step macOS device configuration guide
- Identity & access provisioning checklist
- MFA enforcement verification process
- Inventory tracking system
- Formal offboarding access revocation process
- Documentation templates for repeatability

---

## Key Components

- Mac-first device configuration documentation
- Google Workspace provisioning checklist
- Slack setup and access grouping
- MFA compliance validation
- Asset lifecycle management
- Offboarding audit checklist

---

## Security Considerations

- Enforced MFA at onboarding stage
- Verified disk encryption (FileVault)
- Applied principle of least privilege
- Created structured access revocation process
- Documented account removal verification

---

## Tools Referenced

- macOS
- Google Workspace
- Slack
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Basic networking fundamentals
- Asset inventory tracking

---

## Outcome

This structured onboarding model improves consistency, reduces human error, and strengthens device and identity security posture in a startup IT environment.

This project demonstrates foundational IT operations, process design, and security-aware support practices.
